## Proposal 1
**Link:** 
* [ATP Tennis 2019](https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp/blob/master/atp_matches_2019.csv) (last full season of data was 2019)
* Data goes many years back
    * [Extra Data](https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp)

**Desc:** Dataset includes stats for every tournament played in 2019 including player name, tournament, court surface, winner, loser, score, 1st serve, 2nd serve and many more. Things I can explore with this data would be if first serves made correlate to more matches won? Are there more breakpoints on harder surfaces (hard, grass) than slower surfaces (clay)? Reject or fail to reject that certain parts of the world perform better on certain surfaces. I could also compare generations and see which stats are most important for people that win. Taking that a step further, in recent generatiosn tennis has been dominated by a few athletes; (ie: Federer, Nadal, Djokovic) I could see which stats for lower rank players are good indicators that they will be able to beat them. Test the hypothesis that these indicators do in fact lead to upsets of those 3 players.

## Proposal 2
**Link:** [NBA Season Stats](https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats?select=Seasons_Stats.csv)

**Desc:** Dataset includes basic and advanced stats for teams and individuals for the past 60 seasons. Using this I could compare two indivdual players to see who is better (similar to the tennis dataset). I could compare conferences and reject or fail to reject my hypothesis that west coast conference players are historically better than east coast conference players. 

## Proposal 3
**Link:** [Suicide Rates from 1985 to 2016](https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016?select=master.csv)

**Desc:**  Dataset includes things like country, sex, age, generation, total population, etc. Questions/hypothesese I could answer would be does lower GDP per capita increase the rate of suicide rates? Can explore what factors contribute the most to each demographic on different continents. Compare suicide rates among the different generations. Reject or fail to reject that the younger generations (< 30) suicide rate is higher (possibly due to social media).

# Capstone 1

Completed an analysis on ATP tennis data from 2010 - 2019 in order to determine who is the best player according to the metrics provided in the data.
